## Electric Charge (Điện tích)
1. **Positive or Negative**
2. **Conserved**
    * Charge is not created in the process of rubbing two objects together.
    * The electrification is due to a transfer of charge from one object to another.
4. **\\(q = N \cdot e\\)**

> **\\(N\\) is an integer** \\
> \\(\|e\| = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} (C) \\)

## Electrical Condutors (Chất dẫn điện)
* **Electrical conductors** are materials in which some of the electrons are free electrons.
    * Free electrons are not bound to the atoms
    * Electrons can move freely through the material.
    * Good conductor: copper, aluminum and silver.
    * When a good conductor is charged in a small region, the charge readily distributes itself over the entire surface of the material

## Electrical Insulators (Chất cách điện)
* **Electrical insulators** are materials in which all of electrons are bound to atoms.
    * Electrons can not move freely through the material.
    * Good insulators: glass, rubber and wood.
    * When a good insulator is charged in a small region, the charge is unable to move to other regions of the material.

## Semiconductors (Chất bán dẫn)
* The electrical properties of **semiconductors** are somewhere between those of insulators and conductors.
    * Semiconductor materials: silicon and germanium.
    * Used in making electronic chips.
    * The electrical properties of semiconductors can be changed by the addition of controlled amounts of certain atoms to the material.

## Electrostatics
**Electrostatics**: Tĩnh điện 
## Charging by induction
* Charging by **induction** (hiện tượng cảm ứng điện từ)  requires no contact with the object inducing the charge.
* Examples: See more on powerpoint.

## Coulomb's laws
* The force is a **conservative force** (chỉ phụ thuộc vào điểm đầu và điểm cuối, không phụ thuộc vào đường đi).
* The force is inversely proportional to the square of the separation.(**Inverse - square law**)

* Like charges repel = repel
* Unlike charges attract = attract

## Superposition principle (Nguyên lý chồng chất)
* The **resultant force** on any one charge equals the **vector sum** of the forces exerted by the other individual charges that are present.

## Electric dipole (Lưỡng cực điện)

$$S^2 = 2F^2 - 2.cos2\alpha.F^2 $$

$$S^2 = 2F^2.(1-cos2\alpha) = 4.F^2.sin^2\alpha$$

$$S = 2.F.sin\alpha$$

$$S = \frac{k.q^2.d}{(r^2 + \frac{d^2}{4})^\frac{3}{2}}$$
