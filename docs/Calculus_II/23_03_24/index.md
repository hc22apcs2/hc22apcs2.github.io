## I. A Comparison Test for Improper Integrals

Suppose that $f$ and $g$ are continuous functions with $0 \leq g(x) \leq f(x)$ for $a \leq x$.

(a) If $\int_a^\infty f(x) \ dx$ is covergent, then $\int_a^\infty g(x) \ dx$ is covergent.

(b) If $\int_a^\infty g(x) \ dx$ is divergent, then $\int_a^\infty f(x) \ dx$ s divergent.

_**Be careful:**_ the reverse is not necessarily true: If $\int_a^\infty g(x) \ dx$ is convergent, $\int_a^\infty f(x) \ dx$ may or may not be convergent, and if $\int_a^\infty f(x) \ dx$ is divergent, $\int_a^\infty g(x) \ dx$ may or may not be divergent.
