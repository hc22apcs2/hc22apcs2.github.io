## Polar Coordinate

We choose a point in the plane that is called the **pole** (or origin) and is labeled $O$. Then we draw a ray (half-line) starting at $O$ called the **polar axis**. This axis is usually drawn horizontally to the right and corresponds to the positive $x$-axis in Cartesian coordinates.

If is any other point in the plane, let $r$ be the distance from $O$ to $P$ and let $\theta$ be the angle $\theta$ (usually measured in radians) between the polar axis and the line $OP$ as in Figure 1. Then the point is represented by the ordered pair $(r,\theta)$ and $r$, $\theta$ are called polar coordinates of $P$. We use the convention that an angle is **positive** if measured in the **counterclockwise** direction from the polar axis and **negative** in the **clockwise** direction.
