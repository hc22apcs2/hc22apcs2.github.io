## III. Polar curves

## IV. Length of a curve

## V. The fundamental theorem of Calculus

### * Part 1:

If $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$, then the function $g$ defined by
   
$$
g(x)=\int_a^x f(t) \ dt \ \ \ \ \ \ a \leq x \leq b
$$

is continuous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable on $(a,b)$, and $g'(x)=f(x)$.

### * Part 2:

If $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$, then

$$
\int_a^b f(x) \ dx = F(b)-F(a)
$$

where $F$ is any antiderivative of $f$, that is, a function such that $F'=f$.
